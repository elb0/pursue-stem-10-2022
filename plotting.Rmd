## More things you could try


### Add more artists

In the second line of code, add another artist. Make sure the spelling and capitalisation is extactly as it is in the raw data!

```
  filter(artist_name %in% c("Taylor Swift", "Bruno Mars")) %>% 
```  

### Change colours
Try adding the following code:
```
# only works if you have one or three artists or fewer
scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorchid4", "chartreuse4", "cyan2", "firebrick1"))
```

Change colours, here are some names you can tell R: http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf

### Make separate plots
Try adding the following code:
```
facet_wrap(~arist_name)
```
